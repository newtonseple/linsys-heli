To find a model of the system we started with Newton's 2nd law for rotation, which states that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:N2rot}
\sum \tau = J*\alpha
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ is the external torque, $J$ is the moment of inertia, and $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration. Using this for each of the three axis gives
\begin{equation} \label{eq:system}
J_p\ddot p = K_f 
\end{equation}
